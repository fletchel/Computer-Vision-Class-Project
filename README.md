# Computer-Vision-Class-Project

Project I did for a Computer Vision class in which the assignment was to recognise whether a postbox had mail in it or was empty given a video of the postbox. I used a pretty simple comparison of histograms method as I thought using the simplest possible method that gave good results was the best idea. The performance turned out really well, and theoretically the code should generalise to other situations with some (probably significant) changes.
